# Introduction

I decided to make a brand new and unique Discord user interface for everyone that wanted to experience something new, and it was specially designed for all those members that are a huge fan of my Discord Server called, well, ***Sparkly***, hehe. Yes, just like the Theme :)

# Installation of the Client

First of all you must download ***LightCord***, an application that contains the basic code that will interprete the theme. It's simple to install and is safe(not 100% safe since all applications that edits the original one won't be safe. Most of offline applications should be safe when modifying the original code, however, that might not be the case with applications that contains online features such as ***Discord*** because it might be against their ***ToS***).

Access this link https://github.com/Lightcord/Lightcord/releases and download the latest stable release for your platform (**must be the installer unless you know what you're doing**). After it's downloaded just open the executable and it will install everything automatically.

After the client installation is done you should now have a shortcut on your Desktop called ***Lightcord***, you don't need to have the original Discord open in order to use it, you can even uninstall the original one and just use the standalone client we just installed. 


# Installation of the Theme

After you have succesfully installed and opened the ***Lightcord Client*** go to **User Settings** and scroll all the way down until you find the option called **Themes**.

Now that you're on this section now proceed to download the ***Sparkly*** theme from the **Releases** and download the latest version available, you can quickly access the **Releases** by visting this link: https://github.com/AllisonMichelle/SparklyTheme/releases you must have installed ***Winrar*** in order to be able to extract the files. Access this link https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0 and download the latest release for your **Operating System** and depending if you use **x86 or x64** bits. 

In case that you didn't have Winrar installed it's just as simple as installing the ***Lightcord client*** just open the executable file and follow the instruction, it will do everything automatically. After you have downloaded the theme and installed ***winrar***(in case you didn't have it already installed) just right click on the archive and select **Extract Files**. 

After you have done everything said previously, go back to the Lightcord Client and click on **Open Theme Folder** and now cut and paste the downloaded Theme into that folder. After everything is done, proceed to restart your Lightcord client and when you start it again go back to the **Theme** section inside the Lightcord client and now you should see that there's the ***Sparkly*** theme available, just activate it until the checkbox turns to green and you should be good to go! Yes, that's all you need to do :)
We hope you enjoy it!
